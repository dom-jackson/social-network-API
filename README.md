## Description

This Project is for Challenge 18 of the Monash Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. In this challenge we have been asked to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. All of the inportant sections are included in a functioning table of contents.
